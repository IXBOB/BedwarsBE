## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice - Unauthorized Commercial Use & Attribution Alteration  

### üö® Unauthorized Modification & Commercialization by LQworld Studio  
Recently, I discovered that **LQworld** (a studio with **610,000+ subscribers** on NetEase's Minecraft China Edition) **modified and republished this project without authorization, embedding PAY-TO-WIN mechanics (such as inscriptions and cumulative recharge rankings), while also altering the author attribution**.  
They released a modified version named **"Inscription Bedwars"** on the NetEase Minecraft platform and **monetized it**.  

### ‚ùå Violation of the MIT License  
This project is open-source under the **MIT License**, which allows modifications and even commercial use, but only under the following conditions:  
- **The original author‚Äôs attribution must be retained**.  
- **The full MIT license text must be included**.  

However, **LQworld failed to comply with the MIT license agreement**:  
- **They altered the original author information**, only mentioning me in a "special thanks" section instead of giving proper credit.  
- **They did not include the MIT license text**, violating the **attribution clause**.  
- **They misled users into believing that the project was developed by LQworld alone**.

### üì¢ Protecting Fairness in the Community  
LQworld Studio‚Äôs actions severely **harm the Minecraft developer community**. The purpose of open-source projects is to benefit both developers and players, not to be **exploited for profit by large studios that alter attributions**.  

I have officially reported this case to **NetEase**, requesting the following actions:  
1. **Immediately remove the infringing content**.  
2. **Freeze all revenue generated from the infringing content**.  
3. **Deduct credit points from LQworld‚Äôs developer account**, in accordance with the [NetEase Minecraft Developer Guidelines](https://mc.163.com/dev/mcmanual/mc-dev/mcguide/32-%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%80%85%E8%B4%A6%E5%8F%B7%E4%B8%8E%E5%9B%A2%E9%98%9F/%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B13-%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%80%85%E6%96%87%E6%98%8E%E5%AE%88%E5%88%99.html).  
4. **An official response from NetEase regarding this issue**.  

### üõ°Ô∏è Support the Original Work, Defend Fairness  
If you support **fair competition** and **respect for open-source principles**:  
- **Do not support pirated or infringing content**.

  - Submit bug reports & suggestions: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IXBOB/BedwarsBE_CN/issues)  

This project will **remain open-source**, but I urge all developers to **respect open-source licenses and acknowledge the original authors**, ensuring a fair and healthy developer community.  

Thank you for your support!
